<h1> What Education is Needed to Become a Marine Biologist? </h1>

 <p> Bachelor's degree programs specifically in marine biology usually have required courses in general biology, 
 cell biology, ecology, and evolution. Elective courses, which allow students to concentrate on specific areas of 
 interest, might include marine mammal biology, vertebrate zoology, tropical ecosystems, and fish ecology. Even 
 if a biology program is not specifically focused on marine biology, students can emphasize this aspect by choosing 
 appropriate elective courses. Students who plan to go on to graduate school might complete undergraduate electives 
 in aquaculture, biotechnology, environmental biology, molecular biology, toxicology, and species-specific biology. 
 Additionally, they might take part in volunteer work or an internship to develop valuable practical skills.
 Students who plan to specialize in a marine plant species, like plankton, also should research which graduate 
 schools have faculty with the same interest. It would be difficult, or impossible, for a student to learn about 
 marine plant life in an institution with faculty that primarily teaches animal marine biology. A graduate with 
 a bachelor's degree in a biological science might find entry-level work with the Bureau of Land Management or 
 the National Park Service as a biological aid or technician. He/she could also work in ocean management or policy 
 for government agencies and non-profit organizations.
 </p>
 

 <p>Most independent research and teaching positions at the postsecondary level, however, will require a Ph.D. 
 Topics studied in a doctoral program in marine biology might include phycology (study of algae), fisheries science, 
 and marine microbiology. One of the most important aspects of a Ph.D. program is conducting independent research. 
 From this research, students write a dissertation which they defend in front of a Ph.D. advisory committee. 
 Passing qualifying exams and teaching some undergraduate courses are also common graduation requirements.
 At the terminal Ph.D. level, enrolling in the right program is extremely important, since the research and 
 dissertation can set the foundation for a professional marine biology career. Students should choose a Ph.D. 
 program that is supported by faculty who actively teach and research the subject they're interested in.
