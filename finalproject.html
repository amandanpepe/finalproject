<h1> Welcome to My Homepage! </h1>

<main> Hello and welcome to my webpage! My name is Amanda Pepe and I am a student at Covina High School.
	I am currently taking a computer science course where we have learned the essentials to coding
	websites and how to make them unique. For our final test of our knowledge we have been givent the
	assignment of creating our very own webpage from scratch. I have chosen to dedicate my page to the 
	career Marine Biologist. On this webpage you will be able to access information about what Marine
	Biology is, what Marine Biologist do, and how to become one. Please enjoy! </main>
